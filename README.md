# About me

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub account, my name is Kidd. I recently graduated from Temasek Polytechic with a Diploma in Big Data & Analytics with Merit.

I am interested in coding and programming in general. Currently, I am mainly using Python, however, I have some experience in other languages like HTML, CSS and JS in web development, and SQL and R for data analytics.

This GitHub account is for educational purposes and to show some of the projects that I have done.

I am always happy to learn, so feel free to drop an email or message for me if you see or have any problem, issue or advice about the stuff I do here! :)
